            <p>You can treat mild symptoms of COVID-19 at home with over-the-counter medicine and reduce the chances of viral spread with basic safety steps. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has guidance for at-home treatment of COVID-19.
                The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is studying the safety and effectiveness of molnupiravir, an antiviral drug developed by Merck & Co. that could be taken at home to reduce symptoms in people with mild to moderate COVID-19.
                Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19.
                Beyond that, the FDA has also authorized treatments that may be used for people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and other medications to curb the progression of COVID-19 in people who are not hospitalized but who are at risk for developing severe illness. 
                Scientists continue working hard to develop other effective treatments.
                In October 2021, Merck released promising study results about an oral antiviral drug to treat COVID-19. Compared to placebo,
                the antiviral drug, called molnupiravir, significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization and death in people with mild or moderate COVID-19 who were at high risk for severe COVID. If the FDA authorizes or
                approves this drug, molnupiravir will be the first COVID-19 treatment that can be 
                taken by mouth early in the course of infection to reduce disease severity.
                The study results were based on data from 775 study participants from the US and 
                around the world. To be eligible for the study, the participants had to have been 
                diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, have started experiencing symptoms no more t
                han five days prior to their enrollment in the study, and have at least one risk factor that put them at increased risk for a poor outcome from COVID-19. None of the participants were hospitalized at the time they entered the study. About half of the study participants 
                took the antiviral drug molnupiravir; four capsules, twice a day, 
                for five days, by mouth.
